# DeVerse
Hack-this-fall project

Deverse is a self publishing decentralised platform. The front-end allows the users to self publish their own digital content such as blog posts, articles, poems, research papers, documentaries and a bunch of other things. We use IPFS for file storage because uploading all these files entirely on a blockchain would cost a fortune in the form of gas fees.
Uploading the files on IPFS would mean uploading the meta data of the files like its address or a path that would further help to reference it in the smart contracts.
Payments to creators/authors is usually controlled by a third party or a the organisation that owns the platform which further gets a cut from it. So the idea was to build a decentralised platform so that the the creators/authors could receive their payments directly from the buyers without any help of a third party hence establishing a peer to peer network. One of the major features of blockchain is its immutability, data once put up on blockchain cannot be taken down by anyone. By bringing this service to web3 we intend to remove censorship on the kind of content that an individual can upload on the platform. The creator/author gets complete ownership of their own assets and rights management as blockchain can be used to add time stamps and digital signatures of published files.
We also aim to allow the creators/authors to mint their content in form of NFTs and then be able to trade them in a market place kind of environment.

Majority of the logic is written in solidity and deployed locally on chain. Â We benefited from using these technologies by making the platform as decentralised and censorship-resistant as possible.
